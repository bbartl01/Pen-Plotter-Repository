# Pen-Plotter-Repository

This repository contains all code for the Pen Plotter project.  The Pen Plotter project was a Mechatronics project at Cal Poly SLO in which students had to 
design a robot that could draw images drawn in a program called Inkscape.  

See the link below for documentation of the source code, more information about this project, and a video demonstration of the robot drawing:
